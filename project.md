# Task I chose: Task #1 (Encryption and decryption)

## Task #1: Encrypt and decrypt using an XOR logical operator. (Due May 18th @ 11:59pm)

### Encrypting a message:

- Select a secret "one English word" message. Keep it secret.

- Create a secret “one English word” key. For simplicity, use the same length of the word key as the message. For example, if the message is "Hello," select a key size equal to 5 characters, such as "March."

- Apply XOR bitwise operation between the message and the key.

### Decrypting a message:

- Use the "encrypted message" and the "secret key" and perform the bitwise XOR operation.

- Verify that the decrypted message is the same as the "plain text."

### Output to display

The output should be saved in a text file (output.txt). For example:
```
Plain text: Hello
Key: March
Encrypted text: 5041e0f07
Decrypted text: Hello
```
